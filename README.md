# Still-in-Beta
We are college students majoring in Business Information Systems working on a project for our class, INSC 30833, taught by Dr. Beata Jones

Part of our goal in this project is to implement a GUI based application with "Shopping Cart" functionality for the hypothetical company we work for, Glamping World.
